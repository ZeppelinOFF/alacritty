The VT100 USER GUIDE and ANSI standard X3.64-1979 both list the ANSI ESCape
sequences in alphabetic order by mnemonic, but do not have a have a cross
reference in order by ASCII code.  This paper lists the combination of all
definitions from the three ANSI standards in numeric order.  For a description
of the advantages of using these standards, see the article "Toward
Standardized Video Terminals" in the April-1984 issue of BYTE magazine.

ANSI X3.4-1977 defines the 7-bit ASCII character set (C0 and G0).  It was
written in 1968, revised in 1977, and explains the decisions made in laying out
the ASCII code.  In particular, it explains why ANSI chose to make ASCII
incompatible with EBCDIC in order to make it self-consistant.

ANSI X3.41-1974 introduces the idea of an 8-bit ASCII character set (C1 and G1
in addition to the existing C0 and G0).  It describes how to use the 8-bit
features in a 7-bit environment.  X3.41 defines the format of all ESCape
sequences, but defines only the 3-character ones with a parameter character
in the middle.  These instruct the terminal how to interpret the C0, G0, C1,
and G1 characters (such as by selecting different character-set ROMs).

  Note: NAPLPS does videotex graphics by redefining the C1 set and
        selecting alternate G0, G1, G2, and G3 sets.
  See the February 1983 issue of BYTE magazine for details.

ANSI X3.64-1979 defines the remaining ESCape sequences.  It defines all the C1
control characters, and specifies that certain two-character ESCape sequences
in the 7-bit environment are to act exactly like the 8-bit C1 control set.
X3.64 introduces the idea of a Control-Sequence, which starts with CSI
character, has an indefinite length, and is terminated by an alphabetic
character.  The VT100 was one of the first terminals to implement this
standard.

Definitions:

  Control Character - A single character with an ASCII code with the range
  of 000 to 037 and 200 to 237 octal, 00 to 1F and 80 to 9F hex.

  Escape Sequence - A two or three character string starting with ESCape.
  (Four or more character strings are allowed but not defined.)

  Control Sequence - A string starting with CSI (233 octal, 9B hex) or
  with ESCape Left-Bracket, and terminated by an alphabetic character.
  Any number of parameter characters (digits 0 to 9, semicolon, and
  question mark) may appear within the Control Sequence.  The terminating
  character may be preceded by an intermediate character (such as space).
Character classifications:

C0 Control	000-037 octal, 00-1F hex  (G0 is 041-176 octal, 21-7E hex)
SPACE		040+240 octal, 20+A0 hex  Always and everywhere a blank space
Intermediate	040-057 octal, 20-2F hex   !"#$%&'()*+,-./
Parameters	060-077 octal, 30-3F hex  0123456789:;<=>?
Uppercase	100-137 octal, 40-5F hex  @ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_
Lowercase	140-176 octal, 60-7E hex  `abcdefghijlkmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
Alphabetic	100-176 octal, 40-7E hex  (all of upper and lower case)
Delete		    177 octal,    7F hex  Always and everywhere ignored
C1 Control	200-237 octal, 80-9F hex  32 additional control characters
G1 Displayable	241-376 octal, A1-FE hex  94 additional displayable characters
Special		240+377 octal, A0+FF hex  Same as SPACE and DELETE

Note that in this paper, the terms uppercase, lowercase, and alphabetics
include more characters than just A to Z.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General rules for interpreting an ESCape Sequence:

  An ESCape Sequence starts with the ESC character (033 octal, 1B hex).
The length of the ESCape Sequence depends on the character that immediately
follows the ESCape.

If the next character is
   C0 control:	 Interpret it first, then resume processing ESCape sequence.
     Example:  CR, LF, XON, and XOFF work as normal within an ESCape sequence.
   Intermediate: Expect zero or more intermediates, a parameter terminates
     a private function, an alphabetic terminates a standard sequence.
     Example:  ESC ( A defines standard character set, ESC ( 0 a DEC set.
   Parameter:	 End of a private 2-character escape sequence.
     Example:  ESC = sets special keypad mode, ESC > clears it.
   Uppercase:	 Translate it into a C1 control character and act on it.
     Example:  ESC D does indexes down, ESC M indexes up.  (CSI is special)
   Lowercase:	 End of a standard 2-character escape sequence.
     Example:  ESC c resets the terminal.
   Delete:	 Ignore it, and continue interpreting the ESCape sequence
   C1 and G1:	 Treat the same as their 7-bit counterparts

  Note that CSI is the two-character sequence ESCape left-bracket or the 8-bit
C1 code of 233 octal, 9B hex.  CSI introduces a Control Sequence, which
continues until an alphabetic character is received.

General rules for interpreting a Control Sequence:

1) It starts with CSI, the Control Sequence Introducer.
2) It contains any number of parameter characters (0123456789:;<=>?).
3) It terminates with an alphabetic character.
4) Intermediate characters (if any) immediately precede the terminator.

If the first character after CSI is one of "<=>?" (074-077 octal, 3C-3F hex),
then Control Sequence is to be interpreted according to private standards (such
as setting and resetting modes not defined by ANSI).  The terminal should
expect any number of numeric parameters, separated by semicolons (073 octal,
3B hex).  Only after the terminating alphabetic character is received should
the terminal act on the Control Sequence.

    Control Sequences (defined by ANSI X3.64-1979)

Control Sequences are started by either ESC [ or CSI and are terminated by an
"alphabetic" character (100 to 176 octal, 40 to 7E hex).  Intermediate
characters are space through slash (40 to 57 octal, 20 to 2F hex) and parameter
characters are zero through question mark (60 to 77 octal, 30 to 3F hex,
including digits and semicolon).  Parameters consist of zero or more decimal
numbers separated by semicolons.  Leading zeros are optional, leading blanks
are not allowed.  If no digits precede the final character, the default
parameter is used.  Many functions treat a parameter of 0 as if it were 1.
